# Building a project

* `react-scripts` hide build configuration.
* If we make eject, we will see our real configuration.
* Webpack, Rollup, Parcel are bundlers.
* How bundlers work: https://youtu.be/Gc9-7PBqOC8.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a the most popular bundler for frontend.
* [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) is the most popular bundler for js libs.
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is a zero-config bundler
* Parcel is good for prototyping.
* Webpack is good for bundling large applications.
* Start with Parcel for prototyping and then go with Webpack when needed.
* Rollup is good for libraries.
